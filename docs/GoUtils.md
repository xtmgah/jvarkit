      relationships. 
      Default: [regulates, is_a, negatively_regulates, part_of, positively_regulates]
    -h, --help
      print help and exit
    --helpFormat
      What kind of help. One of [usage,markdown,xml].
    -i, --inverse
      inverse the result
      Default: false
    -o, --output
      Output file. Optional . Default: stdout
    --version
      print version and exit

## Example

children of  GO:0005216 'ion channel activity' 

```
$ java -jar dist/goutils.jar -R is_a  -A 'GO:0005216' 

#ACN	NAME	DEFINITION
GO:1905030	voltage-gated ion channel activity involved in regulation of postsynaptic membrane potential	Any voltage-gated ion channel activity that is involved in regulation of postsynaptic membrane potential.
GO:1905057	voltage-gated calcium channel activity involved in regulation of postsynaptic cytosolic calcium levels	Any voltage-gated calcium channel activity that is involved in regulation of postsynaptic cytosolic calcium ion concentration.
GO:1905054	calcium-induced calcium release activity involved in regulation of presynaptic cytosolic calcium ion concentration	Any calcium-induced calcium release activity that is involved in regulation of presynaptic cytosolic calcium ion concentration.
GO:1905058	calcium-induced calcium release activity involved in regulation of postsynaptic cytosolic calcium ion concentration	Any calcium-induced calcium release activity that is involved in regulation of postsynaptic cytosolic calcium ion concentration.
GO:0016286	small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel activity	Enables the transmembrane transfer of potassium by a channel with a unit conductance of 2 to 20 picoSiemens that opens in response to stimulus by internal calcium ions. Small conductance calcium-activated potassium channels are more sensitive to calcium than are large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels. Transport by a channel involves catalysis of facilitated diffusion of a solute (by an energy-independent process) involving passage through a transmembrane aqueous pore or channel, without evidence for a carrier-mediated mechanism.
GO:0043855	cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel activity	Enables the transmembrane transfer of an ion by a channel that opens when a cyclic nucleotide has been bound by the channel complex or one of its constituent parts.
GO:0043854	cyclic nucleotide-gated mechanosensitive ion channel activity	Enables the transmembrane transfer of an ion by a channel that opens in response to a mechanical stress and when a cyclic nucleotide has been bound by the channel complex or one of its constituent parts.
GO:0099142	intracellularly ATP-gated ion channel activity	Enables the transmembrane transfer of an ion by a channel that opens when ATP has been bound by the channel complex or one of its constituent parts on the intracellular side of the plasma membrane.
GO:0099101	G-protein gated potassium channel activity	A potassium channel activity that is gated by binding of a G-protein beta-gamma dimer.
